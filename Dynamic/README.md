# Dynamic

Coin Taking Game: 
- Time complexity = O(NM), where
    N is the number of elements in pile1
    M is the number of elements in pile2
- Auxiliary space = O(NM)

Finding Words:
- Time complexity = O(KN^2), where
    K is the number of characters in word
    N is the length of the grid
- Auxiliary space = O(KN^2)
