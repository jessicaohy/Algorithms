# Graphs

Building graph:
- Time complexity = O(V+E), where
    V is the number of lines in vertices_filename
    E is the number of lines in edges_filename

Solving:
- Time complexity = O(V+E), where
    V is the number of vertices in the graph
    E is the number of edges in the graph

Cheapest:
- Time complexity = O(Elog(V))
