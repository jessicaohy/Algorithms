# Prefix Trie and Tree

Lookup:
- Time complexity = O(I + Q + P), where
    I is the number of characters in data_file
    Q is the number of characters in query_file
    P is the number of characters in song_ids.txt

Most common:
- Time complexity = O(I + Q + M), where
    I is the number of characters in data_file
    Q is the number of characters in query_file
    P is the number of characters in most_common_lyrics.txt

Palindrome finding:
- Time complexity = O(N^2), where
    N is the length of S
